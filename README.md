# BookResellingPlatform

This is a project which facilitates students of a college to buy and sell books from each other, in a few easy steps.

Technology used: HTML-CSS as front-end; Java, Javascript & JSP; MySQL

Dependancies: TomCat Server, MySQL server, an IDE like Eclipse, mysql-connector-java-8.0.17.jar, jstl.jar, standard.jar

Brief working of the platform:

Students who wish to sell the books would put up a post, along with the price at which they want to sell the book. Details of books are already feeded according to the latest books recommended by the University, to avoid discrepancy. Phone numbers of users are taken to ensure genuine posts. An OTP mechanism could be implemented in future versions.

Students who wish to buy books would be able to filter through all posts according to various filters( Title, Author, Department, Year etc). Out of these posts, user would be able to choose book with lowest price, and add it to their cart. User can buy multiple books in same transaction. For now, payment needs to be done physically. Online payment option could be implemented in future versions.

Biggest advantage of the platform is that it eliminates third party. The work of admins is restricted to maintaining and updating book database according to the ever changing syllabi.
